# Video Summarization and Object Detection

## Introduction

The rapid growth of video content across various platforms presents a challenge in effectively analyzing and summarizing videos. Traditional manual methods for video summarization are time-consuming and often fail to capture the most important content. Object detection techniques, on the other hand, play a crucial role in providing contextual information about the video frames.

The objective of this project is to develop an efficient video summarization and object detection system that automates the process of identifying keyframes and generating concise video summaries. By leveraging computer vision techniques and machine learning models, the system aims to improve the efficiency and accuracy of video content analysis.

## Features

- Real-time and accurate object detection using the YOLOv3 algorithm.
- Identification of keyframes using supervised and unsupervised learning approaches.
- Generation of concise video summaries.
- Integration of object detection and video summarization for enhanced content understanding.
- Efficient navigation and comprehension of large video datasets.

# SumMe 
SumMe dataset was chosen for training and evaluating the summarization models. The SumMe dataset is a collection of 25 videos that have been manually annotated with keyframe-level importance scores by multiple human annotators. The videos were selected to cover a diverse range of content, such as documentaries, sports, and home videos.
The link to download the dataset is provided in the Reference document.

The length of the summarized videos is 15% of the original video length. The models are tested against random videos. The detailed description is given in Video_Summarization.pdf file.
